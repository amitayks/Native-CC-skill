## How to Use This Skill

### Quick Start

1. **Read SKILL.md first** - It provides the complete workflow and decision trees
2. **Choose your platform** - Follow platform-specific sections
3. **Reference docs as needed** - Deep dive into specific topics
4. **Copy patterns** - Use animation-patterns.md for quick implementations

### Typical Workflow

```
1. Project Setup (SKILL.md Phase 1)
   └─ Choose architecture pattern
   └─ Set up dependency injection
   └─ Configure build system

2. Animation Implementation (SKILL.md Phase 2)
   └─ Understand spring physics
   └─ Implement platform-specific code
   └─ Reference animation-patterns.md

3. Performance Optimization (SKILL.md Phase 3)
   └─ Use profiling.md guide
   └─ Profile with platform tools
   └─ Fix bottlenecks

4. Testing & Launch (SKILL.md Phases 6-7)
   └─ Implement test strategy
   └─ Optimize for production
   └─ Monitor metrics
```
